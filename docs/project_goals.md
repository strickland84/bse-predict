BSE-PREDICT (Bitcoin Sol Eth Predict) - Project Goals & Approach
ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY GOALS
Goal 1: Multi-Target Price Prediction

What: Predict Â±1%, Â±2%, and Â±5% price movements for BTC, ETH, SOL
How: Train 9 separate ML models (3 assets Ã— 3 targets) using historical price data and technical indicators
Success: 60-70% prediction accuracy across all models

Goal 2: Automated Trading Intelligence

What: Deliver hourly predictions with confidence scores via Telegram
How: Scheduler runs predictions every hour, formats results, sends via Telegram bot
Success: 99% report delivery rate, clear actionable signals

Goal 3: High-Confidence Alert System

What: Immediate notifications when models are >75% confident
How: Real-time analysis of prediction confidence, instant Telegram alerts for high-certainty signals
Success: Alerts are proven correct 75%+ of the time

Goal 4: Production-Ready Deployment

What: 24/7 system running reliably on VPS
How: Docker containers on Hetzner VPS with automated backups, monitoring, and daily model retraining
Success: 99% uptime, minimal maintenance required
